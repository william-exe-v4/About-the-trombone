        <h1>The creation</h1>
        <p>The trombone has existed for a very long time. Although the inventor is uncertain, it is sure that the trombone dates back to the Renaissance era. The instrument is made of brass with the mouthpiece being silver-plated, though plastic trombones and non-conductive mouthpieces do exist.</p>

          <h1>From its origins...</h1>
          <p>The trombone originated from the trumpet (particularly, the busine). They added a slide to the trumpet because it was all the tech they had of that era for variable sound - valves were still things of sci-fi. It was called the sackbut (Saqueboute in french), originating from the french word sacquer, meaning to draw a sword. Drawing a sword out of the scabbard is in any ways similiar to pulling the slide. The evolution of the sackbut remains really vague, because the British Monarch did not like it, therefore, its trade is forced underground. Not to mention that none of these instruments survived to present day. Currently, the name of the sackbut is the "posaune", meaning large trumpet in German and was named "trombone" in English.</p>

          <h1>A map of the trombone</h1><br>
          <p>The trombone probably has the most simple and straightforward design in our entire band. It consists of only a very long tube that could be adjusted. Essentialy, sound is made by running the buzzing sound produced with the mouthpiece through a tube to amplify and stabilize it. The slide varies the tube length to vary the pitch of the resulting sound. The longer the tube, the lower the sound. Additionally, an "F attachment" may be added as a register to increase the length for easier low notes.</p>

          <h1>In the making</h1>
          <p>This video shows how a trombone is hand-crafted. First, a sheet of brass is shaped into a bell, then, brass tubes are precisely cut to make the slide. The soldering team solders the different tubes together and adds the valves. Then, the trombone is tuned, trimmed, and polished. Afterwards, the trombone is laquered and ready to go.</p><br>

            <p>Make sure that the nut is fastened tightly to ensure no air is escaping. Also make sure that the tuning slide isn't too loose. </p>

            <h1>Tuning</h1>
            <p>Use a tuner to check your trombone if it does not sound normal at first sight. Pull the tuning slide out to make it flatter (lower) and push the tuning slide inwards to make it sound sharper (higher). Normally you would not have to touch the tuning slide as it would usually be all the way in. </p>
            <a href="https://gillesdegottex.github.io/fmit/">The open source desktop tuner I use</a>
            <p>However, many tuning issues arise from the player, not the instrument. Make sure you are putting enough air into each note.</p>
