        <h1>The creation</h1>
        <p>
          The trombone has existed for a very long time. Although the inventor is uncertain, it is sure that the trombone dates back to the Renaissance era. The instrument is made of brass with the mouthpiece being silver-plated, though plastic trombones and non-conductive mouthpieces do exist.

          <h1>From its origins...</h1>
          <p>
          The trombone originated from the trumpet (particularly, the busine). They added a slide to the trumpet because it was all the tech they had of that era for variable sound - valves were still things of sci-fi. It was called the sackbut (Saqueboute in french), originating from the french word sacquer, meaning to draw a sword. Drawing a sword out of the scabbard is in any ways similiar to pulling the slide. The evolution of the sackbut remains really vague, because the British Monarch did not like it, therefore, its trade is forced underground. Not to mention that none of these instruments survived to present day. Currently, the name of the sackbut is the "posaune", meaning large trumpet in German and was named "trombone" in English.
